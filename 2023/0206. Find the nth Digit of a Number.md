Complete the function that takes two numbers as input, num and nth and return the nth digit of num (counting from right to left).

### Note

- If num is negative, ignore its sign and treat it as a positive value
- If nth is not positive, return -1
- Keep in mind that 42 = 00042. This means that findDigit(42, 5) would return 0

### Examples(num, nth --> output)

```
5673, 4 --> 5
129, 2 --> 2
-2825, 3 --> 8
-456, 4 --> 0
0, 20 --> 0
65, 0 --> -1
24, -8 --> -1
```

## Solution:
```py
def find_digit(num, nth):
    if nth < 1:
        return -1
    num = str(abs(num))
    if len(num) < nth:
        return 0
    return int(num[len(num)-nth:len(num)-nth+1])
```

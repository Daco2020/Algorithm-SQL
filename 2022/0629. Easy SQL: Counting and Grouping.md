Given a demographics table in the following format:

\*\* demographics table schema \*\*

-   id
-   name
-   birthday
-   race

you need to return a table that shows a count of each race represented, ordered by the count in descending order as:

\*\* output table schema \*\*

-   race
-   count

Solution:

```
SELECT 
  race, 
  COUNT(id) 
FROM 
  demographics 
GROUP BY race 
ORDER BY count DESC
```

Result:

| race | count |
| --- | --- |
| American Indian or Alaska Native | 23 |
| Asian | 22 |
| White | 19 |
| Black or African American | 18 |

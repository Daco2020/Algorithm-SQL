## Description:

Create a function finalGrade, which calculates the final grade of a student depending on two parameters: a grade for the exam and a number of completed projects.

This function should take two arguments: exam - grade for exam (from 0 to 100); projects - number of completed projects (from 0 and above);

This function should return a number (final grade). There are four types of final grades:

-   100, if a grade for the exam is more than 90 or if a number of completed projects more than 10.
-   90, if a grade for the exam is more than 75 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 5.
-   75, if a grade for the exam is more than 50 and if a number of completed projects is minimum 2.
-   0, in other cases

Examples(**Inputs**\-->**Output**):

```
100, 12 --> 100
99, 0 --> 100
10, 15 --> 100

85, 5 --> 90

55, 3 --> 75

55, 0 --> 0
20, 2 --> 0
```

\*Use Comparison and Logical Operators.

## Solution:

1\. Divide the branch according to the presented conditions.  
2. Return the final grade.

```
def final_grade(exam, projects):
    return (exam > 90 or projects > 10) * 100\
    or (exam > 75 and projects >= 5) * 90\
    or (exam > 50 and projects >= 2) * 75\
    or 0
```

I used 'or' to split a branch without an 'if'.

Given a table of random numbers as follows:

### numbers table schema

-   id
-   number1
-   number2

Your job is to return table with similar structure and headings, where if the sum of a column is odd, the column shows the minimum value for that column, and when the sum is even, it shows the max value. You must use a case statement.

### output table schema

-   number1
-   number2

## Solution:

```
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN MOD(SUM(number1),2) = 1 
    THEN MIN(number1) 
    ELSE MAX(number1) 
  END AS number1,
  CASE 
    WHEN MOD(SUM(number2),2) = 1 
    THEN MIN(number2) 
    ELSE MAX(number2) 
  END AS number2
FROM 
  numbers
```

## Result:

| number1 | number2 |
| --- | --- |
| 208 | 86608 |

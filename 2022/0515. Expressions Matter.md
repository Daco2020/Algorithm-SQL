# Task

-   **Given** three integers a ,b ,c, **return** the **largest number** obtained after inserting the following operators and brackets: +, \*, ()
-   In other words , **try every combination of a,b,c with \[\*+()\] , and return the Maximum Obtained**
    
    ---
    
    # Consider an Example :
    

**With the numbers are 1, 2 and 3** , here are some ways of placing signs and brackets:

-   1 \* (2 + 3) = 5
-   1 \* 2 \* 3 = 6
-   1 + 2 \* 3 = 7
-   (1 + 2) \* 3 = 9

So **the maximum value** that you can obtain is **9**.

# Notes

-   **The numbers** are always **positive**.
-   **The numbers** are in the range **(1  ≤  a, b, c  ≤  10)**.
-   You can use the same operation **more than once**.
-   **It's not necessary** to place all the signs and brackets.
-   **Repetition** in numbers may occur .
-   You **cannot swap the operands**. For instance, in the given example **you cannot get expression** (1 + 3) \* 2 = 8.

# Solution:

```
SELECT GREATEST(((a+b)*c),(a*(b+c)),(a*b*c),(a+b+c))
AS res
FROM expression_matter
```

The functions to find the maximum and minimum values ​​in parentheses are GREATEST and LEAST, not MAX or MIN.

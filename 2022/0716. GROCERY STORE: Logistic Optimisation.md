You are the owner of the Grocery Store. All your products are in the database, that you have created after CodeWars SQL excercises!:)

You have reached a conclusion that you waste to much time because you have to many different warehouse to visit each week.

You have to find out how many different type of products you buy from each producer. If you take only few items from some of them you will stop going there to save the gasoline:)

In the results show producer and count\_products\_types which you buy from him.

Order the result by count\_products\_types (DESC) then by producer (ASC) in case there are duplicate amounts,

### products table schema

-   id
-   name
-   price
-   stock
-   producer

### results table schema

-   count\_products\_types
-   producer

## Solution: 

```
SELECT 
  COUNT(producer) AS count_products_types,
  producer
FROM 
  products
GROUP BY 
  producer
ORDER BY 
  count_products_types DESC, 
  producer ASC
```

## Result:

| count\_products\_types | producer |
| --- | --- |
| 212 | Walter Group |
| 208 | Wisoky Group |
| 203 | Yundt-Gislason |
| 201 | Schowalter, Kohler and Schiller |

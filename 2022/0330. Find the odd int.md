## Description:

Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.

### Examples

\[7\] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).  
\[0\] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).  
\[1,1,2\] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).  
\[0,1,0,1,0\] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).  
\[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1\] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).

## Solution:

1\. Count the number of identical elements.  
2. If the number of elements is odd, the element is returned.

```
def find_it(seq):
    for i in set(seq):
        if seq.count(i)&1:
            return i
```

How to solve using the collections built-in function.

```
import collections
        
def find_it(seq):
    for k, v in collections.Counter(seq).items():
        if v&1:
            return k
```

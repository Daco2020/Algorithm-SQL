## Terminal game move function

In this game, the hero moves from left to right. The player rolls the dice and moves the number of spaces indicated by the dice **two times**.

In SQL, you will be given a table moves with columns position and roll. Return a table which uses the current position of the hero and the roll (1-6) and returns the new position in a column res.

### Example:

```
move(3, 6) should equal 15
```

## Solution:

```
SELECT 
  position + (roll * 2) as res
FROM
  moves
```

## Result:

| res |
| --- |
| 8 |
| 15 |
| 12 |

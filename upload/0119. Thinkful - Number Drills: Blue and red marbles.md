You and a friend have decided to play a game to drill your statistical intuitions. The game works like this:

You have a bunch of red and blue marbles. To start the game you grab a handful of marbles of each color and put them into the bag, keeping track of how many of each color go in. You take turns reaching into the bag, guessing a color, and then pulling one marble out. You get a point if you guessed correctly. The trick is you only have three seconds to make your guess, so you have to think quickly.

You've decided to write a function, guessBlue() to help automatically calculate whether you should guess "blue" or "red". The function should take four arguments:

- the number of blue marbles you put in the bag to start
- the number of red marbles you put in the bag to start
- the number of blue marbles pulled out so far (always lower than the starting number of blue marbles)
- the number of red marbles pulled out so far (always lower than the starting number of red marbles)

guessBlue() should return the probability of drawing a blue marble, expressed as a float. For example, guessBlue(5, 5, 2, 3) should return 0.6.

## Soluton:
```py
def guess_blue(blue_start, red_start, blue_pulled, red_pulled):
    remaining_blue = blue_start - blue_pulled
    remaining_red = red_start - red_pulled
    total_remaing = remaining_blue + remaining_red
    return remaining_blue/total_remaing
```
